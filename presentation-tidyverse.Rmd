# Introduction

Let's tackle some of the biggest questions a person who has never 
heard of the "tidyverse" might ask.

## What is the "tidyverse"?

Literally, it is a set of packages that follow
"tidy" data principles. The main packages include `ggplot2`, `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
More information can be found at the [tidyverse website] [tidyverse_website].

[tidyverse_website]: https://www.tidyverse.org/

## What are "tidy" data principles?

Here's a quote from the [vignette for the tidyr package] [tidyr_vignette]
written by Hadley Wickham, who is the author of
several of the tidyverse packages and one of the leaders of the 
tidyverse "movement". ^[A vignette is a document that comes with a package
that explains some of the functions/use cases of a package.]

[tidyr_vignette]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tidy_principles_vignette.png")
```

To help visualize these principles,
here's an image from [**R for Data Science**] [r4ds],
a free online book co-authored by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

[r4ds]: http://r4ds.had.co.nz


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tidy_principles_r4ds.png")
```

FYI: The principles of tidy data are "formally" outlined
in Wickham's paper [**Tidy data**] [tidy_data_paper].

[tidy_data_paper]: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html

## What does "untidy" data look like?" 

Here's a list provided by Wickham regarding the most common problems that prevent
a data set from being tidy. ^[Guidance for the structure and code
for this section is provided by the tidyr vignette.]

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tidy_common_problems_vignette.png")
```

These common issues might be better understood with a couple of examples.

The following example illustrates the first issue listed by Wickham:
values encoded as column headers. The data set comes from a report by the Pew
Research Center regarding the relationship between religion and income in the U.S.

```{r}
pew <- tbl_df(read.csv("data/pew.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = FALSE))
pew
```

Nevertheless, it can be tidied fairly easily!

```{r}
pew %>%
  gather(income, frequency, -religion)
```

This next example illustrates the second issue: multiple variables in one column.
This data set reflects tuberculosis information gathered by the World Health Organization.

```{r}
tb <- tbl_df(read.csv("data/tb.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
tb
```

Although the variables for country and year (i.e. `iso2` and `year`) are already correctly
encoded as columns, the variables/columns for demographics are combined together across
several columns. (i.e. `m04`, `m514`, etc.) These columns implicitly store information
regarding gender and age. The first letter `m` or `f` indicates male or female,
and the digits indicate age ranges (e.g. `m514` indicates males who are ages 5 through 14).

Two operations are needed to tidy this data set. ^[For illustrative purposes,
the intermediate result is stored. This does not exactly represent a "best practice".]


```{r}
tb2 <-
  tb %>% 
  gather(demo, n, -iso2, -year, na.rm = TRUE)
tb2

tb3 <-
  tb2 %>% 
  separate(demo, c("sex", "age"), 1)
tb3
```

More examples can be found in the tidyr vignette.

### A Quick Aside... "What is this 'tibble' that I see in some examples?"

A tibble is just a data frame that is "smart" about how it is printed to the RStudio
console. ^[Subsetting is also slightly different with tibbles.]
The **R for Data Science** book explain
this feature in the following manner.


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tibble_r4ds.png")
```

## Why should I use tidy data principles?

  1. It defines a framework for structuring data that makes analysis easier.
  It facilitates and, in fact, mandates **consistency**.

  2. In terms of programming syntax, tidy data facilitates the use of R's vectorized
  programming principles. This means that performing operations (e.g. via functions
  like `summarise()`) on large sets of data
  and transforming data quickly (e.g. via functions like `mutate()`)
  is natural and easy.


Related to the first point is the idea of having a singular, definitive method
of performing a single task. Tidyverse functions and tidy data principles
promote this idea. [^fn_drob] Although one may argue that having many ways 
of performing the same operation can be an advantage,
this can also easily lead to "sloppy",
irreproducible data storage and manipulation.

[^fn_drob]: See [David Robinson's breakdown] [drob_article]
of the "base R vs. tidyr" argument for more information.

[drob_article]: http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/

For example, note that there are several valid ways of manipulating a column without using
tidyverse functions. (Here, I'm using the `mtcars` dataset that is
automatically loaded when R is loaded.)

```{r}
mtcars$pounds <- mtcars$wt * 1000
mtcars[["pounds"]] <- mtcars[["wt"]] / 1000
mtcars[, "pounds"] <- mtcars[, "wt"] / 1000
```

The singular "tidy" way of doing the same task is arguably easier to comprehend.

```{r}
mtcars <-
  mtcars %>%
  mutate(pounds = wt / 1000)
```


## What else should I know about the tidyverse and tidy data?

In my opinion, the tidyverse is much more than just a set of packages,
and tidy data is more than just data structured according to a set of principles.
These are underlying
constructs of a larger, more abstract **mentality** that emphasizes
**readability** and **reproducibility**.
These principles are coveted in the realm of data science and analysis.

By **readability**, I'm alluding to the manner in which the tidyverse
naturally emphasizes data manipulation and analysis actions with verbs.
For example, the [vignette for the dplyr package] [dplyr_vignette]
describes its implicit implementation of this principle.

[dplyr_vignette]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/dplyr_verbs_vignette.png")
```

FYI: All of dplyr's functionality is captured succintly in the "Data Transformation"
"cheat sheet" on RStudio's website. [^fn_cheatsheets]

[^fn_cheatsheets]: Many more helpful R
"cheat sheets" can be found
at <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/dplyr_cheatsheet.png")
```

The readability provided by the verbs in tidyverse functions
is complemented/facilitated by
the "pipe" operation. "Piping" can easily be done
using magrittr's `%>%` operator with functions in tidyverse packages.
The notion of "piping" may not be completely unfamiliar to those accustomed
to programming.
(For example, the "+=" operator implements "piped" addition in C++.)
To those unfamiliar,
with piping, it is essentially the composition mathematical function
(i.e. `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`).

Combined with good code style, piping can make code self-expanatory.
For example, see the following comparison of dplyr operations
using the nycflight13 package. ^[This nycflights13 code is
borrowed from the dplyr vignette.]

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("nycflights13")){
  install.packages("nycflights13")
}
```

```{r, results = "hold"}
library("nycflights13")
dim(flights)
flights
```


Even though the data is tidy and the code
uses dplyr functions, the second set of commands using the pipe operator
are inarguably easier to interpret because the operations are performed in
an ordered fashion (i.e. left-to-right, top-to-bottom). (The first method is 
less comprehensible because the operations are performed from "inside to out".)


```{r}
filter(
  summarise(
    select(
      group_by(flights, year, month, day),
      arr_delay, dep_delay
    ),
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  arr > 30 | dep > 30
)
```

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  select(arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
  summarise(
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(arr > 30 | dep > 30)

```

By **reproducibility**, I'm referring to the many tools available to make
code documentation easy. For example, this document is actually a .Rmd
document that is converted to html via the `knitr` package. It allows for
code to be written alongside text, images, and other kinds of figures.
Notably, I could
have just as easily turned the same underlying document to a pdf simply by changing
a single variable.


## Why is this all even important? Why can't I just start coding?

Diving into R and learning as much as possible as quickly as possible is
highly encouraged! However, it is a good idea to learn good data science principles
early on in your learning so that you can completely avoid frustrations that
are easily avoidable and mistakes that you might make otherwise.

# Conclusion

To exhibit the power and elegance
of using tidyverse functions and tidy data principles, here are a
couple of final examples.

This example comes from an article on David Robinson's blog. [^fn_drob_article]
The data set concerns gene expression. Note how he is able to easily manipulate
and visualize the data set to gain meaningful insight.

[^fn_drob_article]: This article
discusses the "base R vs. tidyr" argument in regards to how to teach beginners.
He makes a strong case in favor of tidyr principles, or, at the least, not avoiding
it completely.

```{r, size = "tiny"}
url <- "http://varianceexplained.org/files/Brauer2008_DataSet1.tds"


# Clean and tidy the data
cleaned_data <- read_delim(url, delim = "\t") %>%
  separate(NAME, c("name", "BP", "MF", "systematic_name", "number"), sep = "\\|\\|") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(name:systematic_name), funs(trimws)) %>%
  select(-number, -GID, -YORF, -GWEIGHT) %>%
  gather(sample, expression, G0.05:U0.3) %>%
  separate(sample, c("nutrient", "rate"), sep = 1, convert = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!is.na(expression), systematic_name != "")

# Visualize a set of four genes
cleaned_data %>%
  filter(BP == "leucine biosynthesis") %>%
  ggplot(aes(rate, expression, color = nutrient)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~name + systematic_name)
```

Even if you know nothing about gene expression, it should not be too difficult
to understand the steps that are taken to generate a deliverable that can be
used to gain understanding. The same could
not necessarily be said for applying other coding styles/techniques.

This next example is adapted from a very recent RStudio webinar on the exact
same topic that is discussed here--the tidyverse! [^fn_webinar] 
It uses the famous "gapminder" data set that is
seen in some of Hans Rosling TEDTalks.

[^fn_webinar]: See
https://github.com/rstudio/webinars/tree/master/46-tidyverse-visualisation-and-manipulation-basics
to download the materials. Also, see https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/
for RStudio's webinars.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("gapminder")){
  install.packages("gapminder")
}
```


```{r, size = "tiny"}
library("gapminder")
top_10 <-
  gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1952) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdp)) %>% 
  top_n(10, gdp) %>% 
  pull(country)
# top_10


gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% top_10) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(scaled_gdp = gdp / first(gdp)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = scaled_gdp, color = country)) +
  labs(title = "GDP Per Capita (Scaled)")
```

Again, note how powerful (yet simplistic), the tidyverse can be!
